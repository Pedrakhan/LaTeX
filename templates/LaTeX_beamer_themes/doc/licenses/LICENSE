Licenses for the Beamer class
=============================

Different parts of the Beamer class package are distributed 
under different licenses:

1. The code of the package is dual-license. This means that
   you can decide which license you wish to use when using the
   beamer class. The two options are:

   a) You can use the GNU Public License, version 2.
   b) You can use the LaTeX Project Public License, version 1.3c.
   
2. The documentation of the package is also dual-license. Again,
   you can choose between two options:

   a) You can use the GNU Free Documentation License, version 1.2.
   b) You can use the LaTeX Project Public License, version 1.3c.

The ``documentation of the package'' refers to all files in the
subdirectory doc of the beamer package. A detailed listing can be
found in the file

  doc/licenses/manifest-documentation.txt

All files in other directories are part of the ``code of the
class and package.'' A detailed listing can be found in the file

  doc/licenses/manifest-code.txt

You will find the licenses in the manual and also as plain text
versions in the directory
